## Project Description
This project is a discord bot built around the core fundamental ideals of worldwide communication; whoever you are, wherever you are, one should be able to communicate and talk in a meaningful way with loved ones and strangers alike! It is a beacon of education as well as communication, one that we are proud of making and one that encourages more social interaction!

This project was built with Discord and Google Translate APIs, VSCode, and a copious amount of StackOverflow. (+ love)

In order to run our bot, all you need to do is invite him into your server and voila! Social interaction! No more awkwardly fumbling around Google Translate mid-way through a conversation with your overseas friends!

## Features

## Testing
In order to test our project, all we mainly did was write a couple lines of code and compile to ensure that nothing went wrong (this also helped in a big way when we found code that broke our program because of an error in a certain line I accidentally added).
Because we only had 1 server to work on, we would take turns activating our version of the bot (since we were all adding different things to the bot) in order to test what works and what didn't before handing the bot over to our teammates (we shared the discord bot token).
Testing the quotes, help, and translate functions were fairly easy as they involved looking at what the bot sent in the #general chat and cross-referencing it with what we expected it to output whereas testing the start function was slightly more complicated as it involved threads, something that is fairly new in Discord which meant that at times, we were scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to figure out what was going wrong.
Overall, the testing went well and we were able to overcome all our obstacles and make a working bot.
